Repository for website development group project: Restaurant website

This project involves creating a website for a fictional restaurant, complete with menus, a reservation system, and contact form. While HTML/CSS will establish and style the platform, JavaScript will manage reservation data, and form validation. Additional functionalities might include a virtual tour using photos or an ordering system for take-out.
